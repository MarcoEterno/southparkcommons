## Overview of the procedure
### Previous methodology
before the introduction of our procedure, the test for Covid-19 was done in the following way:
- 1) A swab was used to collect genetic material from the nostrils of every patient.
- 2) The swabs were collected, and each one was put in a different test tube, submerged in a liquid designed to break the outer layers of the virus, making the eventual viral RNA free in the solution.
- 3) Each test tube was put in a machine called Real Time Polimerase Chain Reaction Machine (RT_PCR). After about 3 hours, in the test tubes where the viral genome was present, the RT-PCR manages to amplify the quantity of the genome so much that now we can see it with the naked eye. for those patients the test is positive. For the other patients, the test is negative.

### Problem with the previous methodology
The main problem with the methodology was the throuput. Hospitals in Italy were equipped with no more than 4 RT_PCR machines, and most have only one. Each Machine can process only 96 test tubes at a time, ant the procedure takes 4.5 hours in total (pre-processing + RT-PCR). This meant that the biggest hospital has capacity for about 4x96x24/4.5 = 2048 tests a day, and smaller hospitals could do only 500. Talking with hospital personnel, as well as epidemiologists, the real demand for tests was about ten times that. This lead me to the invention of the new protocol, that was perfected in the virology lab of Pisa, under the supervision of Professor Pistello. 

### Our Methodology

Our methodology is equal to the previously used for the points 1 and 2 mentioned above. The only difference, is what we put in the RT-PCR machine in step 3. 

In fact, after the genetic material of the swabs has been placed in the test tubes, you can take a part of that genetic material from a collection of test tubes, say 16 for example, and place it in a single new test tube. Than put this "aggregated" test tube in the RT_PCR machine. 
 - If the test tube comes up negative, you can immediately call all the 16 people and tell them that they are all negative, while having used just 1/16 of the RT-PCR capacity as before.
 - If it comes up positive, you split the genetic material of the original patience in groups of 8 (16/2) and re-do the aggregated test. 

 So in synthesis, every time an "aggregated" test tube comes up negative you discover the negativity of all the patients, and every time it comes up positive you split it in half and do the subtests. After some passages where you split in half, you end up doing the test of single people, and that can tell you with certainty who is positive

 ### Analysis
 This method is convenient when the probability of being sick is very low, and saves precious throughput in the RT-PCR machine, because on average you need to do less tests.
