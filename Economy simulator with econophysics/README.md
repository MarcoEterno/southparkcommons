# Econophysics meets ABMs : a step towards realism
Master's thesis regarding the issue of economic inequality from a physics perspective, extending the work of Thomas Piketty. 

## Extended Abstract

During the 1960s Mandelbrot observed that the exchanges of money that occur in economic interactions are analogous to exchanges of energy between molecules in a gas: econophysics was born.

Since then, econophysics has become a well established branch of physics, where the elegance of mathematic formulae has often been put before the understanding of real world implications of the research, favouring simplicity and beauty to realism.

Meanwhile, economics tried to forge the tools to inform economic policies since the Great Depression of 1929. It went through a series of models, each one addressing the problem of the previous generation of models, and each one with its own fallacies.

The state of the art in economic research are the Agent-Based Models (ABMs), which are criticized for relying heavily on simulations and lacking a simple and intuitive mathematical description.


This thesis aims at bringing together the complexity of ABMs with the sim- ple mathematical description of econophysics in order to address the issue of economic inequality and wealth distribution in the long run, in a similar fashion to what the economist Thomas Piketty did in his book “Capital in the 21st century”.

This is achieved in two ways:
- Developing new mathematical tools and frameworks to apply the econo- physics model of Dr ̆agulescu-Yakovenko (DY model) to real world phenom- ena like the study of social mobility and the development of optimal fiscal and monetary policy.
- Creating a new model of capital exchange based on the DY model in which the contribution of financial investments, consume, income and taxes are implemented.

The final objective of this thesis will be of practical nature: to address fiscal and monetary policies. But in doing so, a wide range of physical ideas will come to life: trade will be explained with thermodynamics, social mobility will be stud- ied with Brownian motion and path integrals, fiscal policy will be discussed with
the Euler-Lagrange equations, and monetary policy will reveal a phenomenology for the DY model quite similar to bands in crystals.

The thesis is structured as follows:
- In chapter 1 the development of economics and econophysics are analysed, trying to stress the difficulties that both disciplines encounter in studying the issue of inequality. The work of Piketty is presented as the starting point of our work.
- In chapter 2 the DY model of capital exchange is presented: we review the thermodynamics of it, write the Boltzmann equation, find the equilibrium wealth distribution, and discuss a procedure of our own to measure social mobility. Finally, the comparison between the DY model predictions and real world data on wealth distribution is explored.
- In chapter 3 it is demonstrated with a proof of our own design, that per- turbations to the equilibrium in the DY model decay exponentially in time. In the proof, a structure similar to band in crystal is discovered in the DY model.
- In chapter 4 our extensions of the DY model are presented. The contribu- tion of financial investments, consume, income and taxes are implemented. The time evolution and final shape of the wealth distribution are analysed for each new economic variable, and taxes are found to be the only way polarization between riches and poors can be avoided.
- In chapter 5 we solve the problem of designing optimal fiscal policy in the DY model with the help of production theory. We propose tho paths lead- ing to the optimal taxes: one computational, using stochastic gradient de- scent, and the other theoretical, using the analogy with the Euler-Lagrange equations for our system.
- In chapter 6 our study of the perturbations around the equilibrium of the DY model is used in the design of monetary policy. The concept of equilib- rium time for an economy is presented and calculated in the U.S. economy from the 1950s until today.
- In chapter 7 the conclusions of our work are drawn and our main findings are summarized. Promising leads for future research are identified both in the extension of our model, and in possible new uses of the mathematical tools we developed throughout the work.
